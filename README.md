Guessing Game for C220
The purpose of this game was to teach me how to organize commands in an effective way. It taught me the importance of syntax and order within code, and how a few simple mistakes can hinder the performance of the entire program. It also gave me experience with simple data types and how to properly use and execute them within a project. I also learned there are multiple ways to approach a concern, and some ways I can go about a few of them.

In this Guessing Game, the player is asked to guess a number on a certain scale. If they guess something that is not an integer, they will be asked again to guess a number. Depending on the relation of their guess to the answer, they will be told the number is either too high or too low, and will be asked to guess the number again. Once they guess the number, they will be applauded and asked if they would like to play again.
